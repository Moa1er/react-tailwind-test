# PLAN

## Current Focus
- Stand Editor shell with basic info fields and contact management accordion completed; scrolling restored across views.

## Stand Editor State
- Basic Info fields tracked in `standForm`: `companyName`, `productRef`, `description` with light gray rounded inputs.
- Contacts accordion defaults open with sample contacts (Lena Fischer, Samir Patel); supports add and delete actions.

## Navigation & Layout
- `standEditor` view now renders the Stand Editor form (replaces prior placeholder) inside the mobile-width layout.
- Global page scrolling enabled by allowing the body/root to grow and scroll instead of being locked.

## Next Steps
- Implement remaining Stand Editor features: AI generator mock, Pros & Cons list, Photo Gallery, Tag Selection.
- Continue maintaining updated project plan checkboxes as features are completed.
