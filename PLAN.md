# PLAN

## Current Focus
- React + Vite + Tailwind project structure with dedicated view files (dashboard, project view, stand editor, tag manager, export).
- Stand editor now sends AI requests to `/api/chatgpt` (Vercel Edge) using `OPENAI_API_KEY`; the UI auto-falls back to local mock suggestions if the key or API is unavailable.

## Application State
- Project data lives in `src/App.jsx` using React state; initial seeds: Future Mobility Expo (active), Luxury Hospitality Summit, Immersive Tech Fair.
- Stand editor form defaults to the AeroDynamics booth with description, pros/cons, an empty photo rail ready for uploads or camera captures, and two contacts; contacts accordion defaults open. Photo gallery now includes a live `getUserMedia` preview with explicit start/stop controls and capture-to-canvas snapshots (environment facing when available), plus a separate file upload rail that instantly previews every added image. There is also a native device camera trigger (`capture="environment"`) that opens the platform camera interface and funnels the captured photo into the same preview rail.
- Global tag palette: Sustainability, Innovation, VR/AR, Hospitality, Retail. Tag manager can append autogenerated tags with random palette colors.
- View routing is controlled by `activeView` (dashboard, project, standEditor, tagManager, export). Sidebar buttons swap views on desktop, while mobile devices use a fixed bottom icon-only navbar (with a plus icon for new projects) that stays visible while scrolling.
- AI generation flow triggers the `/api/chatgpt` Edge function for live ChatGPT responses; responses update description, pros, and cons with graceful fallback text when unreachable.

## Next Steps
- Wire stand tags to the global tag manager data structure for true selection rather than previews.
- Persist project/stand edits to storage so reloads keep changes.
- Add export actions (PDF, CSV, asset download) and connect to the photo gallery items.
- Add explicit local dev proxy instructions (or tooling) so the ChatGPT Edge route works without `vercel dev`.
