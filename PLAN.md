# PLAN

## Current Focus
- React + Vite + Tailwind project structure with dedicated view files (dashboard, project view, stand editor, tag manager, export).
- Maintain the stand editor experience (AI description helper, pros/cons lists, contacts accordion, photo rail) while enabling global tag previews.

## Application State
- Project data lives in `src/App.jsx` using React state; initial seeds: Future Mobility Expo (active), Luxury Hospitality Summit, Immersive Tech Fair.
- Stand editor form defaults to the AeroDynamics booth with description, pros/cons, photo rail placeholders, and two contacts; contacts accordion defaults open.
- Global tag palette: Sustainability, Innovation, VR/AR, Hospitality, Retail. Tag manager can append autogenerated tags with random palette colors.
- View routing is controlled by `activeView` (dashboard, project, standEditor, tagManager, export). Sidebar buttons swap views; new projects are created via the sidebar action.

## Next Steps
- Wire stand tags to the global tag manager data structure for true selection rather than previews.
- Persist project/stand edits to storage so reloads keep changes.
- Add export actions (PDF, CSV, asset download) and connect to the photo gallery items.
